The dataset contains two attributes: **description** and **points**. The description is a brief text describing the wine and the points represent a quality metric ranging from 1 to 100. If some wine has at least 90 points it is considered **exceptional**. Your task involves predicting if some wine is **exceptional** based on its review."
